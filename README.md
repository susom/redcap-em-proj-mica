# MICA

This is an External Module (EM) designed for the Motivational Interviewing Conversational Agent (MICA) Project.

### About the Chatbot

The chatbot is a standalone PHP/REACT-based app, functioning as a REDCap External Module. It operates in tandem with the [SecureChatAI EM](https://github.com/susom/secureChatAI).

### Content of this EM

The frontend REACT component is programmed to produce static build files which can be incorporated into the DOM of an external website for more seamless UI integration or as its own dedicated view. This EM will be enabled only on the MICA Project. Note, this UI will continue to interact with Stanford's dedicated Secure Chat AI instance.
